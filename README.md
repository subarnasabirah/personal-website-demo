## Technical Specification

High performance, Unidirectional data flow, and a Small learning curve influence me to choose reactjs for this project,
another reason is AmarLab Limited, It was a high preference to use reactjs for this project. To develop faster and interactive UI/UX used React UI library `ant`, it also gives some extra benefits like high-quality React components, design resources and development tools etc.

Maybe it would have been better if I could have been ensured 100% test case, redux selector used, data fetching loading
state, make API call with pagination and configuration option to change location and radius from UI
interaction etc. Due to the time limitation I am unable to do ensure all of those right now.

- CSS folder architecture followed by BEM.
- React UI library `ant` that contains a set of high-quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces.
- Follow the Airbnb design system for JS code writing.
- Used Prettier for code formatting concerns.
- Used Eslint to be flexible and configurable for the use case.
